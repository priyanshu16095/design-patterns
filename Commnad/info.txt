the command design pattern is a behavioural design pattern that turn a request into a stand-alone object.

the key idea behind this is to decouple the sender(client) of the request from the reciever, in simple language remove dependency of client from reciever

command
    -interface for executing a particular operation
    -typically include 'execute' method
concrete command
    -implement command interface
    -holde a reference to reciever object
