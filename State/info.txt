state design pattern is a behavioural pattern that allows an object to alter its
behaviour when its internal state changes

the pattern represents each state of an object as an individual class

example: traffic light
            -red state
            -green state
            -yellow state
        in this example
            -traffic light represents the context class
            -each state is defined in a different class
            -the behaviour is encapsulated in these classes
